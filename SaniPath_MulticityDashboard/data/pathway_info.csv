Bathing Water,https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2010/12/13/10/02/bath-2192_1280.jpg,Bathing water can come from many sources and may be stored in the household or used straight from the source. Bathing water can be contaminated directly from the source or through human interactions during storage or use.,"As noted, contamination can occur directly from using a contaminated source or fecal contamination can be introduced by hands or objects used during storage or bathing. Behaviors that may increase the risk of exposure to fecal contamination are accidental/intentional ingestion of bathing water while bathing, use of unsafe water for bathing, and potentially from improper storage of bathing water."

People may walk through floodwater, pick up items in floodwater, or clean their house after flooding and these behaviors can affect their risk of exposure to fecal contamination through this pathway."
Municipal Drinking Water,https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2016/09/21/14/46/faucet-1684902_1280.jpg,"Municipal drinking water is an important source of drinking water and water for other household needs in many places around the world, and the type of source and availability can vary dramatically from city-to-city or neighborhood-to-neighborhood. Drinking water quality can vary depending on how the water is sourced, if it is used directly from the source, or if it is stored in a container, and these have important implications for the risk of exposure to fecal contamination.","Drinking water can be contaminated directly from the source, during the distribution process through piping or from the tap, or during storage prior to use. Water treatment by chlorination, filtration, boiling and other means can reduce the contamination present in drinking water."

Produce that does not grow on a tree, does not have a peel or shell and that  is eaten raw and uncooked can pose important health risks for those ingesting it.","Contamination of produce can occur at many steps along the pathway from farm to finger. Contamination could be introduced  via use of unsafe wastewater irrigation practices, lack of produce washing regulations at the farm, during transport to markets, by hands and surfaces in the market, and by hands and surfaces in the household. This study focused only at one point along this pathway, specifically at the market vendor, and further research is needed to determine which steps contribute to fecal contamination of raw produce. Behaviors also play a role in exposure, and behaviors that may increase risk of exposure to fecal contamination can include increased consumption of raw produce due to variations in diet and cultural norms, lack of handwashing prior to eating, and  the absence of produce washing practices. Washing produce can be an important barrier in the exposure route of fecal contamination, however this study did not investigate the impact washing had on contamination since this takes place in the private domain."
