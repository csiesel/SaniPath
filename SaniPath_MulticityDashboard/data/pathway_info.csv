Bathing Water,bw_icon.png,bw.png,Bathing water can come from many sources and may be stored in the household or used straight from the source. Bathing water can be contaminated directly from the source or through human interactions during storage or use.,"As noted, contamination can occur directly from using a contaminated source or fecal contamination can be introduced by hands or objects used during storage or bathing. Behaviors that may increase the risk of exposure to fecal contamination are accidental/intentional ingestion of bathing water while bathing, use of unsafe water for bathing, and potentially from improper storage of bathing water."
Floodwater,fw_icon.png,fw.png,Many communities around the world experience routine flooding during rainy season in areas that lack or have inadequate drainage management systems.,"Floodwater can interact with open drains, surface water, latrines, wastewater-irrigated soils, feces from open defecation, and other contaminated environmental pathways that can lead to fecally contaminated floodwater. People may walk through floodwater, pick up items in floodwater, or clean their house after flooding and these behaviors can affect their risk of exposure to fecal contamination through this pathway."
Municipal Drinking Water,dw_icon.png,dw.png,"Municipal drinking water is an important source of drinking water and water for other household needs in many places around the world, and the type of source and availability can vary dramatically from city-to-city or neighborhood-to-neighborhood. Drinking water quality can vary depending on how the water is sourced, if it is used directly from the source, or if it is stored in a container, and these have important implications for the risk of exposure to fecal contamination.","Drinking water can be contaminated directly from the source, during the distribution process through piping or from the tap, or during storage prior to use. Water treatment by chlorination, filtration, boiling and other means can reduce the contamination present in drinking water."
Open Drain Water,od_icon.png,od.png,Open drains are a common form of drainage management in developing countries and their accessibility makes them a common dumping site for household waste as well as raw sewage.,"Behaviors that increase risk of exposure can include walking through open drains, retrieving items that have fallen in drains, accidentally entering drains, or practicing open defecation into open drains. Contamination can occur directly through open defecation, dumping of grey water, black water, or fecal sludge, or it can occur indirectly through interaction with other pathways such as runoff from rain or floodwater or intrusion of contaminated surface water."
Raw Produce,pr_icon.png,pr.png,"Produce is an important part of the diet for many people around the world. Produce that does not grow on a tree, does not have a peel or shell and that  is eaten raw and uncooked can pose important health risks for those ingesting it.","Contamination of produce can occur at many steps along the pathway from farm to finger. Contamination could be introduced  via use of unsafe wastewater irrigation practices, lack of produce washing regulations at the farm, during transport to markets, by hands and surfaces in the market, and by hands and surfaces in the household. This study focused only at one point along this pathway, specifically at the market vendor, and further research is needed to determine which steps contribute to fecal contamination of raw produce. Behaviors also play a role in exposure, and behaviors that may increase risk of exposure to fecal contamination can include increased consumption of raw produce due to variations in diet and cultural norms, lack of handwashing prior to eating, and  the absence of produce washing practices. Washing produce can be an important barrier in the exposure route of fecal contamination, however this study did not investigate the impact washing had on contamination since this takes place in the private domain."
Street Food,sf_icon.png,sf.png,"Street food is common in the diet of many people in urban areas globally. Street food is food that is prepared and sold on the street, and can be cooked or uncooked.","Contamination of street food can occur at many different points such as during preparation, during storage prior to selling, from hands, and from other activities. Behavior that could increase exposure include increased frequency of consumption of street food and improper hand hygiene from the vendor or the consumer."
Surface Water,sw_icon.png,sw.png,"Surface water is an important environmental factor to consider when evaluating human exposure to fecal contamination. Surface water can be used for drinking, personal and household cleaning, cooking, and can be interacted with in varying ways, such as swimming, fishing, or walking through surface water such as rivers and streams. Different uses of and interactions with surface water impact how ingestion occurs and how much water is ingested, ultimately impacting risk of exposure to fecal contamination if surface water is contaminated.","Surface water can become contaminated in many ways, such as from drainage of rainwater or open drains, open defecation, fecal sludge dumping, cleaning of potties or nappies, hanging latrines, and from other pathways. Behaviors that can play a role in exposure include activities such as cleaning/washing, swimming, fishing, walking through water, or practicing open defecation."
Public Latrine,ls_icon.png,ls.png,"Public latrines are an important factor in urban sanitation, especially when private household latrines are unavailable or where populations are mobile and away from home during the day. Public latrines, as with household latrines, can come in a variety of designs, all of which have implications on potential public health impact if not properly used and managed.","Public latrines can become contaminated due to unhygienic use, contamination from hands that are transferred onto surfaces, improper cleaning and maintenance practices, and from flies transferring fecal matter. Behaviors that can contribute to exposure include use and frequency of use of public latrines, contact with surfaces within the latrine structure, hand hygiene, and from cleaning latrines. Handwashing can be an important measure to reduce hand contamination after latrine use."
Ocean,ow_icon.png,ow.png,"In many countries, oceans are used for recreation, fishing, and washing, and beaches are common sites for open defecation and disposal of other waste. Interaction with ocean water varies person-to-person based on personal behaviors which has implications for potential ingestion of fecally-contaminated water.","Contamination of ocean water could occur due to runoff from rain, open defecation practices, fecal sludge dumping, or from tidal cycles that interact with households, open drains, or latrines. Behaviors such as swimming, washing, and fishing in oceans can play an important role in exposure to fecal contamination, as well as other practices that result in contact with the water. Ingestion can occur directly or indirectly from hands or other objects, such as food."
Other Drinking Water,odw_icon.png,odw.png,"In areas that lack access to municipal drinking water sources, are unable to utilize this source (due to water shortage, price, etc.), or prefer alternative sources,  residents rely on alternative sources of water used for drinking in their everyday lives. Sources could include private boreholes, shallow wells, bottled or jar water, or natural springs.","Due to the wide range of possible sources, there are a large variety of ways in which contamination could occur. As with municipal drinking water, contamination could occur directly from the source, during the distribution process through piping or from the tap, or during storage prior to use. Water treatment by chlorination, filtration, boiling and other means can reduce the contamination present in drinking water."
